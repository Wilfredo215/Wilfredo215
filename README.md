As a full stack engineer, I have extensive experience working on both the front end and back end of technology. 
I have a strong understanding of a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for front end development, 
and Python, Java, and Ruby for back end development. I have also worked extensively with APIs, integrating different systems and 
ensuring smooth data transfer between them. Currently, I am employed as a full stack engineer, where I use my skills and knowledge 
to develop and maintain both the front end and back end of complex systems.
